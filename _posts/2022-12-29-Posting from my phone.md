Thanks to github.dev and VS Code, I can create blog posts from my phone. Its not the easiest method, but at least it's possible.

You can now open a text editor anywhere you can open a web browser thanks to GitHub Codespaces. All you need is a GitHub repository URL, and make one small change.

Change
https://github.<bold>com</bold>/mikesheehy/mikesheehy.github.io
to
https://github.<bold>dev</bold>/mikesheehy/mikesheehy.github.io
and Codespaces will open the project in a text editor, no installation required!

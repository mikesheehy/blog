My first article! I'll be using this blog to document my projects and my journey through DevOps. I hope this will be a way to keep myself accountable to trying new technologies, as well as give my Code Kentucky students ideas on their next steps after graduation.

This first article focuses on this website, which was built using jekyll and hosted through GitHub.

I"D<p>My first article! I’ll be using this blog to document my projects and my journey through DevOps. I hope this will be a way to keep myself accountable to trying new technologies, as well as give my Code Kentucky students ideas on their next steps after graduation.</p>

<p>This first article focuses on this website, which was built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and hosted through <a href="https://github.com/mikesheehy/mikesheehy.github.io">GitHub</a>. The intention of this site it to create a platform to display my new projects, my learning progress, and my achievements. Eventually, I’d like to add components that Code Kenucky students can use to learn more about front end web development, as well as give them an opportunity to contribute to a project using their new GitHub skills.</p>

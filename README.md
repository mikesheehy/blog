# mikesheehy.github.io
This was the repo for <a href="http://mikesheehy.github.io">mikesheehy.github.io</a>. This experience taught me a lot about Jekyll and Liquid, but looking forward to giving my GitHub page a new design and functionality while moving my blog elsewhere.

The blog was created with <a href='https://jekyllrb.com' target='_blank'>Jekyll</a> and the disign is using <a href='https://getbootstrap.com' target='_blank'>Bootstrap</a>.

To contribute to the blog, you will need to create a new markdown file (.md) file inside the _posts folder with the date and subject in the title (Needs to follow <2022-06-11-sample blog post> template).

From there, you will need to create a pull request. If you haven't done one before, <a href='https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request' target='_blank'> this will will teach you how to create a pull request</a>.
